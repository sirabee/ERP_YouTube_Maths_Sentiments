## Executive Summary

This report summarizes comprehensive research conducted to investigate and improve sentence-level sentiment analysis for educational YouTube comments. The research resolved a significant performance discrepancy, validated methodological approaches, and tested enhanced aggregation methods across multiple BERT models.

## Research Objectives

1. **Investigate Performance Discrepancy**: Resolve the 37% vs 71.5% agreement rate discrepancy in Twitter RoBERTa predictions
2. **Enhance Aggregation Methods**: Implement and test hierarchical, aspect-based, and ensemble approaches
3. **Validate Learning Journey Detection**: Assess methods' capability to detect educational progression patterns
4. **Compare BERT Models**: Evaluate Twitter-RoBERTa, YouTube-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa performance
5. **Methodological Validation**: Confirm sentence-level approach effectiveness for educational sentiment analysis

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Discrepancy Resolution

**Discovery**: The 37% vs 71.5% discrepancy was due to different aggregation methodologies, not model issues.

- **Baseline (37% accuracy)**: Original Variable K aggregation with complex learning journey detection and final-third weighting
- **Fresh Implementation (72.5% accuracy)**: Simplified sentence-level aggregation with basic majority voting

**Evidence**:

- 10/10 sample predictions differed between baseline and fresh implementation
- Baseline predictions traced to `aligned_annotations_predictions_20250813_222930.csv`
- Fresh implementation matched manual annotations more frequently

**Conclusion**: The sentence-level approach is methodologically sound; the issue was over-complex aggregation strategy.

### 2. Enhanced Aggregation Methods Performance

**Test Setup**: 200 manually annotated comments, 4 aggregation methods tested

**Results**:
| Method | Accuracy | Cohen's Kappa | F1-Score |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Original (Fresh) | 72.5% | 0.531 | 0.620 |
| Hierarchical | 71.5% | 0.494 | 0.617 |
| Ensemble | 67.5% | 0.454 | 0.590 |
| ABSA | 63.0% | 0.388 | 0.538 |

**Key Insights**:

- **Original method performed best**: Simple aggregation outperformed complex approaches
- **ABSA excelled at positive sentiment**: 91.9% accuracy on positive educational comments
- **Hierarchical showed promise**: 71.5% accuracy with phrase-level analysis capability
- **Method consensus**: 54% of samples had all methods agreeing and correct

### 3. Learning Journey Detection Analysis

**Dataset**: 13 manually identified learning journeys out of 200 comments (6.5%)

**Performance**:
| Method | Learning Journey â†’ Positive | Overall LJ Accuracy |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Original | 92.3% (12/13) | 84.6% (11/13) |
| ABSA | 92.3% (12/13) | 84.6% (11/13) |
| Ensemble | 92.3% (12/13) | 84.6% (11/13) |
| Hierarchical | 69.2% (9/13) | 61.5% (8/13) |

**Conclusion**: Original sentence-level method is optimal for learning journey detection in educational comments.

### 4. BERT Model Comparison

**Test Setup**: Original sentence-level aggregation applied to 3 BERT models

**Results**:
| Model | Accuracy | Cohen's Kappa | F1-Score | Avg Confidence |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| XLM-RoBERTa | 73.0% | 0.540 | 0.616 | 0.791 |
| Twitter-RoBERTa | 72.5% | 0.531 | 0.620 | 0.779 |
| YouTube-BERT | 72.0% | 0.511 | 0.613 | 0.906 |

**Sentiment-Specific Performance**:

- **Positive sentiment**: XLM-RoBERTa (95.9%) > Twitter-RoBERTa/YouTube-BERT (87.8%)
- **Educational content**: XLM-RoBERTa (85.2%) > Twitter-RoBERTa (80.2%) > YouTube-BERT (77.8%)

**Statistical Significance**: Performance differences are minimal (0.5-1.0 percentage points), potentially within margin of error.
