          "My school had those timed math tests too. But instead of stickers, anyone who finished with all right answers in one minute either got eat outside for lunch or got extra recess time. I don't think I finished on time once. This isolated from friends and showed that I wasn't smart. I struggled in other areas too. I literally couldn't read until my mom single handedly taught in 3rd grade (now reading is a favorite hobby). I have AHDH, dyslexia, and math dyslexia (I have no clue how spell technical name), but none of those were caught or even considered until adulthood when I put in effort find answers. So I spent my entire early years thinking I was stupid, even though I was actually a smart kid. I completed first draft of a whole novel at age 14 and played multiple instruments (making top in my state on one) in high school. I was smart. But they didn't see that. When I got older, I actually understood algebra better than my peers. Everyone complained about letters, but for whatever reason it clicked in my brain a lot of time. I still struggled, but I was one of 5 kids in my entire school get top scores on state test. Geometry was hell. I didn't understand at all and barely made it by. Even in algebra, where my math skills shined, I couldn't do anything in my head. I had write down every single step, even ones that most of my peers could do in their heads. I got comments about how much paper I wasted because kids are cruel. It's taken years, and I'm still trying unlearn all of that negative stuff. My teachers told over and over that I wouldn't have a calculator with everyday. I understand it was a different time, but they were also super wrong. So who cares if I can't do math mentally. Or when I can it's in some weird way that everyone says is stupid and more complicated than how they were taught? As long as I have right answer (or close enough not hurt anyone) then who cares how I got there?"
