    - expression given in image defines Euler-Mascheroni constant, denoted by \(\gamma\): \[ \gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} - ...

Topic 3: 3_2x_equation_integers_64 (48 comments)
  Representative Comments:
    - Actually, premise is correct: x, y in N exist s.t. 2x-4y = 3 does imply that 4^(2x-4y) = 64, since A -> B is true when A is false, if only vacuously. ...
    - Well answer 64 is still true because question asks "If x and y are positive integers such that 2x - 4y = 3" sentence "If false, then A" is always true...
    - X and Y are positive integers , so I take x=1,put in equation so y =-1/4 , put x and y value u will get ans 🫡. equation is also correct and ans is 64...
