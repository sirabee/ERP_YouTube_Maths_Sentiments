  Representative Comments:
    - Note: x >_ 1 for both square roots be valid. rewrite original equation as (1-1/x)^(1/2) = x - (x-1/x)^(1/2) Squaring leads x2 - x + 1 = 2sqrt(x2 - x) ...
    - I solved by: Multiplying both sides by sqrt(x), sqrt(x^2 - 1) + sqrt(x - 1) = x sqrt(x) Moving sqrt(x-1) right side and taking square on both sides, x...
    - You can also do this problem directly, with no particular "heroics," simply squaring both sides of equation eliminate square roots, simplifying isolat...
