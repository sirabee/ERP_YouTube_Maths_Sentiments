Topic 1: 1_angle_20_80_2x (47 comments)
  Representative Comments:
    - How about thrbfact that sum of angles in a triangle is 180¬∞? If you construct a line BC, then you have two triangles with angle BPC being twice angle ...
    - in quadrilateral ABCP conceder angleABC =x and then angle apc will be 2x (by property) so you in quadrilateral ABCP angle APC will be 360-2x , by addi...
    - Let angle BAC = y. Therefore BPC = 2y Let angles CBP and PCB both = x (isoceles triangle) These produce two equations: One in triangle BPC : 2x+2y = 1...

Topic 2: 2_15_60_10_answer (38 comments)
  Representative Comments:
    - way I‚Äôve always solved these problems is I think myself how many times does 9 go into 60? About 6.666 times (9x6=54. 60-54=6. 6/9=0.666. 6+0.666=6.666...
    - This is one of those things where right way is most confusing 9/60 = .15 which is 15% also 6 is 10% so 3 is 5% 6+3=9 and 10+5=15...
    - Ok, you've hit answer on head. 10% (or one-tenth) of 60 is 6, so answer is B. 'half as much', 6+3, is 9, so 10% add 5%, give 15% And as a check 15% is...
