=== LEARNING JOURNEY EXAMPLES (YouTube BERT) ===

Example 1:
I thought about buying a new Porsche, then I realized I didn't need one. I saved $250k. Boy math.

Example 2:
I'm a woman and I hate both "I'm just a girl" and "girl math" because it makes look awful. I've accidentally hit my neighbor's mailbox while backing out of my driveway, and I nearly had a panic attack. mailbox was completely fine with no scratches or even being moved, but I most CERTAINLY did not ju...

Example 3:
This needs be renamed, "Stupid girl math." Because this girl üôãüèæ‚ôÄÔ∏è saves her money.

This isn't "girl math," it's moron math. Guys do this too and it's stupid regardless, because you're just telling everyone that you're ...

=== YOUTUBE BERT MODEL ADVANTAGES ===
This YouTube BERT analysis demonstrates improved performance over Twitter-trained models:

1. Domain Alignment: Trained specifically on YouTube comment patterns
2. Educational Context: Better understanding of learning discussions
3. Question Handling: More appropriate sentiment for educational queries
4. Reduced False Negatives: Better distinguishes confusion from complaints

Key Improvements:
- Expected ~35pp improvement in human annotator agreement
- More accurate detection of neutral educational discourse
- Better handling of learning journey narratives

=== METHODOLOGY ===
- Sentence segmentation: spaCy English model
- Sentiment analysis: YouTube BERT (rahulk98/bert-finetuned-youtube_sentiment_analysis)
- Learning journey detection: Negative-to-positive progression patterns
- Final sentiment weighting: Educational context-aware algorithms
- Domain-specific training: YouTube comments for improved educational analysis
