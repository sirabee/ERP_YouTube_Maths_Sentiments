=== VARIABLE K-MEANS SPECIFIC INSIGHTS ===
This analysis applies sentiment analysis to Variable K-means topic assignments.
Variable K-means clustering identified 12 distinct topics from
mathematical education discourse, providing a different perspective from HDBSCAN.
The sentiment patterns can be compared with HDBSCAN results for algorithmic
comparison and validation in mathematical education research.

=== EDUCATIONAL INSIGHTS ===
Variable K-means topic modeling with sentiment analysis reveals specific
emotional responses to mathematical education content. This approach enables
comparison between different clustering algorithms (Variable K-means vs HDBSCAN)
in identifying sentiment patterns within mathematical learning discourse.
